# hello-world
Who knows what life will bring?
Hello. I am Sam Heilman. I have a bachelor's degree in biology and I am exploring master's programs here at U of M-D. I also have an interest in computer programming and wish to be able to apply these skills to biology. In my free time, I also like to run, read, dance, birdwatch, and watch Agents of SHIELD on Netflix.
